# DIVINE_COMMANDLINE
DIVINE COMMAND LINE - Grammatical search tool / Hebrew Bible BHS + Quran / Right-Aligned-Text command line tool


Ive made a short python script that 1) extracts the Hebrew from Biblehub.com 2) extracts the grammatical parsing info from Biblehub.com, but only for Genesis 12 as a test.
A .txt file is produced, with each word scraped in order (i.e. a list of words in the order they appear) , now we'd need to add the parsing grammar data for each word. I think it would be easiest to make a script so that the data appears after eacg word in brackets, so we can just put it all on one .tsv file, but there might be a better way idk.
